### Steps followed 

STEP 1: DATA PREPARATION


- Obtain Data: Download the Adidas datasets, which contain sales information such as total sales, profits, units sold, product types, and sales dates.

-  Visualize Data Table: After loading, navigate to the table view and verify the data’s integrity.

STEP 3: SETTING UP THE DASHBOARD


- Adjust Canvas Settings: Change the alignment and dimensions of the canvas to ensure a balanced dashboard layout.

- Insert a Shape: Use a rectangle to create an area for the title.

- Add Text Box: Place desired text (e.g., “Adidas Sales Analysis”) in the shape and customize the font and color to enhance visibility.

STEP 4: ADDING KPIs

The dashboard should prominently feature several KPIs:

1. Total Sales

4. Average Price per Unit

5. Average Margin

- Insert Cards: Use Power BI’s card visual to represent the KPIs visually.

- Set Formatting Options: Adjust visuals’ sizes and formatting (like font size, color, and layout) for consistency.


STEP 5: DETAILED VISUAL ANALYSIS

Sales by Month

- Create an Area Chart: Insert an Area chart to monitor total sales by month.

-  Configure Chart Data: Assign invoice dates to the x-axis and total sales to the y-axis. Use date hierarchies for better clarity.

-  Fine-tune Visuals: Format chart elements such as titles, axis labels, and colors.

Sales by State

-  Insert a Map Visual: Use a geographical representation to illustrate sales per state.

- Color Saturation: Use total sales as a metric for saturation to highlight high-performing regions.

Sales by Region

-  Build a Donut Chart: Visualize sales data by region using a donut chart to discern contributions from various geographic areas.

-  Add Legends: Configure legends appropriately so that they display region names and corresponding sales figures.

Product Performance Analysis

-  Use Bar Charts: To show total sales by product.

-  Interactive Filters: Add slices for product type to allow users to filter the view dynamically based on their selections.

STEP 6: RETAILER PERFORMANCE

-  Duplicate Bar Chart: Create a second bar chart that indicates sales by retailers.

-  Format and Visual Adjustments: Ensure the chart legend is effectively labeled, and the color scheme aligns with the overall dashboard theme.

STEP 7: ADDING INTERACTIVITY

-  Insert Slicers: For regions and states enabling quick filtering of data on the dashboard.

-  Format Slicers: Set visual styles and instructions for ease of navigation.

-  After placing slicers, ensure that other visual elements (like charts and cards) respond appropriately to selection changes from the slicers.

STEP 8: REVIEW AND INSIGHTS

- Backtrack through visualizations to derive insights on peak sales periods, underperforming regions, and products.

- Discuss the implications of these insights in decision-making for Adidas’s strategy regarding inventory and marketing.

STEP 9: FINAL ADJUSTMENTS
